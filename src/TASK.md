# Task

The task is to write a production-ready tool that, given any number between 1 and 1,000 inclusive, returns the grammatically correct English phrase for this number (e.g. given 111 it shows “one hundred and eleven”, given 21 it shows “twenty-one”).

The code should be production-ready and it would be great if you can complete the task using Clojure or JavaScript but you are free to use any language you are more comfortable with. Your project will be reviewed by Signal’s Engineering team and we are curious to see:
1. how you solve the problem
2. what choices you make
3. how you deliver the project
